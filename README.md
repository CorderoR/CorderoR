## About Me
Iâ€™m a recent graduate from Yale University that combines a corporate background in large-scale technology deployment and operations with hands-on technical expertise in AI, ML, LLMs, and software development. On campus, I served as a Teaching Fellow for graduate and undergraduate computer science and AI courses, mentoring students in programming, data structures, and applied machine learning. My work bridges the gap between technical execution and strategic impact, whether in the classroom, in industry, or through ventures like Pathway, an AI-powered platform supporting non-traditional community college and veteran transfers.

## ðŸ§® Mathematics as a Professional Toolkit
I have a deep interest in:  
- Linear Algebra for powering data transformations, ML optimizations, and computer vision pipelines.  
- Probability Theory & Statistics for driving decision-making under uncertainty, risk modeling, and data analysis for AI systems.  
- Harmonic Analysis & Real Analysis for applied in signal processing, neural network theory, and large-scale data interpretation.  
- Number Theory & Discrete Mathematics for essential for algorithm design and computational efficiency.  
- Formal Proof Writing for ensuring algorithmic correctness, robust system design, and scalable architectures.  

At Yale, I conducted self-directed **[research under the guidance of Professor Ronald Coifman](https://math.yale.edu/news/2023-math-student-prizes)**, exploring the connections between harmonic analysis, Fourier methods, and neural network architectures. This work deepened my understanding of how mathematical theory can inform and optimize AI and ML systems, particularly in areas like feature extraction, data compression, and pattern recognition.

In my corporate and technical projects, these fields underpin work in **AI model development**, **predictive analytics**, **optimization algorithms**, and **secure systems design**. I also plan to release a **Mathematics Roadmap** for self-directed learners, providing resources and structured pathways for mastering these topics in ways that are directly applicable to technology and industry.
